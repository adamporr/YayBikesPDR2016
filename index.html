            <h1 class="page-header">Decision makers hit the road</h1>

            <section data-place="rides">
	      <p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, an hour on a
	      bike must be worth a thousand hours of planning,
	      meetings, charettes, and reports! At least, that is the
	      thought behind the new Professional Development Ride
	      program introduced
	      by <a href="http://www.yaybikes.com">YayBikes!</a> in
	      2016 in partnership with
	      the <a href="http://www.dot.state.oh.us/pages/home.aspx">Ohio
	      Department of Transportation</a>. The concept is
	      simple. If local decision makers have the opportunity to
	      experience their community first hand as a cyclist,
	      they'll better understand the transportation needs of
	      their constituents and how best to serve them.</p>

	      <img class="sidebar-content" src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5645dea9e4b0639705d8b2dd/t/576ae69df7e0ab9ac46e3a30/1466623649423/?format=750w"></img>

	      <p>Our professional development rides are designed to
	      provide opportunities to experience a community's
	      current street infrastructure by bike to better
	      understand how to:</p>
	      <ol>
		<li>Engineer and evaluate bicycle-related infrastructure</li>
		<li>Inform and educate all road users</li>
                <li>Enforce laws governing behaviors that lead to conflicts between people on bikes and other road users</li>
		<li>Encourage active transportation</li>
	      </ol>

	      <p>Previous participants have reported increased
	      understanding of why cyclists make the choices they do
	      and understanding what makes for an effective bicycle
	      accommodation. In their own words:</p>

	      <p class="quote">"I learned there is a huge difference
	      between a well designed bike lane or facility and one
	      that is just thrown in last minute to a project to make
	      it a complete street."</p>

	      <p class="quote">"I got a feel for the perspective of a
	      bicycle rider. I also learned some things about general
	      bicycling practices that are contrary to what I’d
	      previously thought (lane positioning, platooning at
	      traffic signals, etc.). These are things that will aid
	      me as I’m working on different issues pertaining to
	      bicycling."</p>

	      <p class="quote">"I learned quite a bit about what looks
	      good on paper may not be the right solution in real
	      life."</p>

	      <p class="quote">"If I want to expand my engineering judgment, I need
	      to experience it. And it was a lot different than I
	      thought. Yay Bikes! gave our team a whole new
	      perspective. As engineers, we’re focused on making it
	      work, but Yay Bikes! gave us feedback from a customer
	      perspective."</p>

	      <p>Professional development rides are 3 hour experiences
	      customized for each community to feature as many types
	      of infrastructure as possible within approximately 8–10
	      miles. They roll at a casual pace accessible to most,
	      and include several stops to discuss the experience of
	      riding different streets, as well as traffic law and how
	      it pertains to best bicycling practices. Ride leaders
	      are extensively trained transportation cyclists and
	      educators with deep respect for participants'
	      professional expertise.</p>

	      <h2>2016 year in review</h2>
              <p>Although our first professional development ride did
		not take place until mid-August, we made up for lost
		time and led 18 rides in the remainder of the year.  The
		111 participants who participated in the rides
		represented a wide variety of professions including
		engineers, planners, mayors, city managers, police
		chiefs, and stakeholders in the parks, health, and
		business development communities. </p>

                series of small towns in Hamilton County east of
                Cincinnati.  The group included representatives from
